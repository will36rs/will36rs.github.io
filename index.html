      I've been solving problems by crafting software for 10+ years.
    </p>
    <p>
      I can plan, design, implement, test, deploy, and monitor web applications written in <a rel="external" href="https://www.php.net/manual/en/preface.php">PHP</a> and <a rel="external" href="https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/about/">Ruby</a>, being most productive when using <a rel="external" href="https://laravel.com/docs/10.x#why-laravel">Laravel</a> and <a rel="external" href="https://guides.rubyonrails.org/getting_started.html#what-is-rails-questionmark">Ruby on Rails</a>.
      I use practices like <a rel="external" href="https://kanban.university/kanban-guide/">Kanban</a> and <a rel="external" href="https://www.scrum.org/learning-series/what-is-scrum/">Scrum</a> and tools like <a rel="external" href="https://docs.docker.com/get-started/overview/">Docker</a> and <a rel="external" href="https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-What-is-Git%3F">Git</a> to shorten the time it takes to deliver value to clients in collaborative and incremental ways.

    <p>
